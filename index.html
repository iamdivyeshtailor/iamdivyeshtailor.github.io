        <h4 style="color: white; text-align: center;">This is How Our Project Will Look Like.</h4> 
        <p>We have take 4 raspberry pi 3 B and put them in a series of 4. So that this 4 device will work in parallel and give output in a single unit.
            Raspberry pi has its own OS called Raspbian
            As we know raspberry pi only has 1 gb of onboard memory
            Some programs can only utilize  25% of total cluster capability. They use one core per node making it inefficient
            A modern Core i7 can easily beat 4 node rpi cluster in single threadded workloads.
            Building a rpi cluster on bigger scale makes it more expensive 
            It is only Good for some type of parallel Workloads.

        <p>A powerful feature of the Raspberry Pi is the row of GPIO (general-purpose input/output) pins along the top edge of the board. 
            A 40-pin GPIO header is found on all current Raspberry Pi boards (unpopulated on Pi Zero and Pi Zero W). 
            Prior to the Pi 1 Model B+ (2014), 
            boards comprised a shorter 26-pin header.</p>
        <p>Any of the GPIO pins can be designated (in software) as an input or output pin and used for a wide range of purposes.</p>
        <p>the numbering of the GPIO pins is not in numerical order; GPIO pins 0 and 1 are present on the board (physical pins 27 and 28) but are reserved for advanced use</p>
