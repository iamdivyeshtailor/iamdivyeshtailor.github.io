        <p>This is How Our Project Will Look Like.</p>
          <p>We have take 4 raspberry pi 3 B and put them in a series of 4. So that this 4 device will work in parallel and give output in a single unit.
            Raspberry pi has its own OS called Raspbian
            As we know raspberry pi only has 1 gb of onboard memory
            Some programs can only utilize  25% of total cluster capability. They use one core per node making it inefficient
            A modern Core i7 can easily beat 4 node rpi cluster in single threadded workloads.
            Building a rpi cluster on bigger scale makes it more expensive 
            It is only Good for some type of parallel Workloads.</p>
